        <h3>SAGE Project</h3>

       <p class="imagecite"><strong> Source: Margaret Hamiltion In Action, Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Margaret_Hamilton_-_restoration.jpg">Margaret Hamiltion (software engineer)</a></strong></p>
       
        <p>From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the 
        <b>Semi-Automatic Ground Environment Project</b> at the MIT Lab. This was
        an extension of Project Whirlwind, which was an essential
        stepping stone in regards to advancements in aviation.
        It used computers to simulate any type of aircraft, and connect
        it to a cockpit mock-up. 
        
        The SAGE Project was developed for the military to locate enemy aircrafts.
        Margaret's contributions absolutely set up software engineering
        as a respectable discipline, as her involvement and therefore aid
        in what was a success, proved that software engineering was worth considering
        as a field.</p>
        
        <h3>MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and the Apollo Guidance Computer</h3>

      <strong><p class="imagecite"> Margaret Hamiltion, Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Margaret_Hamilton_-_restoration.jpg"> Margaret Hamiltion (software engineer)</a></strong></p>
        
        <p> In 1965, she became aware of the of the Apollo project and wanted to 
        join it. She became the first programmer hired and was the first female 
        programmer for this project at the MIT Insrumentation Lab. She was 
        responsible for testing the software for the Apollo spacecraft's 
        Command and Lunar Module.</p>
        <p>The guidance system is an integral part to the success of any
        rocket or space exploration mission. It provides stability for the
        rocket and controls during maneuvers. Margaret and her team's contributions
        may well have set up the rest of the century's - or at least NASA's - 
        avancements in the space exploration field. She was the cornerstone, the
        building block, of software engineering in regards to space exploration.
        For any advancement to be made, someone has to do it first, someone has to take the
        first step, and that was Margaret. Without her, the leading names
        in space exploration and science - such as NASA - likely wouldn't be where they 
        are today.</P>
        
        <p>The moon landing marked the first time humans landed on the moon. Hiltion was nominated for the NASA Space Act Award for her work.</p>
