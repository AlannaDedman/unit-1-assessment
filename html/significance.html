        <p>Margaret Hamiltion has had a significant impact on computer science, 
        as she was one of the first computer software programmers and is 
        responsible for the software that allowed astronauts Neil Armstrong and 
        Buzz Aldrin to land on the moon. 
        <br><br>The moon landing is - unsurprisingly - considered one of the 
        greatest scientific accomplishments of the 20th century, and Margaret 
        Hamilton was at the forefront of it. Without her contributions to the mission,
        it likely would not have been a success, and she will forever go down in
        history as the woman who made man walk on the moon. 
        <br><br>Hamiltion was credited for coming up with the term "software engineering" during the early Apollo Missions, when it was not taking seriously compared to other types of engineering. She also gets credit for helping open the door for women to succeed in STEM.</p>
